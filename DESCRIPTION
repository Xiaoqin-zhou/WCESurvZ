Description: WCESurvZ provides tools for calculating weighted survival rates 
    and survival data based on sample events and event times. It includes functions 
    for performing logrank tests for comparing two groups, accounting for recurrent 
    events, and simulating data based on event distribution parameters. The package 
    is designed to facilitate advanced survival analysis incorporating weighted 
    composite endpoints.
